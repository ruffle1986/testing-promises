Testing promise based code
==========================

This is my experimental repo where I try to find better ways to
test promise based code.

At the time, I use [ava](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ava) to test my code
because it has great [Promise support](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ava#promise-support)

To run the tests, just type the following command in your terminal:

```sh
$ npm test
```
